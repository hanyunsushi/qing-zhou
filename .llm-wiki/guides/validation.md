# Validation Guide

Run from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run typecheck
npm --prefix frontend run build
git diff --check
```

The provider tests cover OCI signing (including PKCS#1 and PKCS#8 keys), OCI transfer-unit parsing, Cloudflare Pages/Workers aggregation, provider error handling, encrypted storage, credential masking, and administrator-only routing. The front-end contract test verifies the page, direct refresh endpoint and sidebar order.
