# Validation Guide

Run from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run typecheck
npm --prefix frontend run build
git diff --check
```

The provider tests cover OCI signing (including PKCS#1 and PKCS#8 keys), OCI transfer-unit parsing, Cloudflare Pages/Workers aggregation, provider error handling, encrypted storage, credential masking, and administrator-only routing. The front-end contract test verifies the page, direct refresh endpoint and sidebar order.

## Production deployment record

On 2026-09-15, `qingzhou:kreeper-7e0f784` was loaded on the OCI host and deployed with a service-only `docker compose ... up -d --no-deps qingzhou`. The existing data volume and production environment file were preserved. Container health plus local and public `/api/health` responses verified version `v0.2.80-kreeper-7e0f784`.

The encrypted OCI profile was exercised directly inside the QingZhou container after deployment: OCI Usage API returned a successful official-usage snapshot. The Cloudflare profile remains unconfigured pending a dedicated Account Analytics Read token; do not use a Wrangler OAuth session or DNS/ACME token for this check.
