// StartQueueAdvance periodically promotes queued plan buckets whose active head
// has been exhausted or has expired, so the next purchase in that renewal line
// takes over. Purchases advance their own user synchronously (in the buy
// transaction);
// this ticker covers the later exhaustion/expiry transitions, which have no
// synchronous trigger. A promotion changes which sing-box identity is live, so a
// config rebuild is scheduled whenever anything advanced. Mirrors the
// StartCertRenew ticker pattern.
//
// It is a backstop, not the only path: advanceQueueOnRead promotes a user's份 the
// moment their dashboard or subscription is fetched, so nobody waits out an
// interval — or stays stranded if this loop is unhealthy.
//
// The first sweep runs immediately rather than one interval in, so accounts that
// are ALREADY stuck (queued份 behind a套餐 that expired while the old code was
// running) are activated at startup instead of after the panel has been up for
// two minutes. That makes the upgrade itself the repair.
//
// wg (may be nil) lets shutdown wait for an in-flight sweep. A sweep holds write
// transactions, and the startup one runs at exactly the moment a restarting panel
// is most likely to be told to stop again — without this the deferred store Close
// can fire mid-transaction and log a "database is closed" failure for promotions
// that were half done. Same treatment the sing-box controller loop already gets.
